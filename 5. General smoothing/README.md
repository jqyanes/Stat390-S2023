# Assignment details

Create a function that takes the output of each smoother in smoother.pck and calculates its press statistic. Simplest way to do it: put it in each smoother.

Apply each to the NOAA.new data using the parameters given.

Now create a function that uses a greedy random search to find better values of the adjustable parameters, based on minimizing PRESS.
